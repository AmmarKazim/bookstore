# My first full-stack project for practice

> Feb 3, 2025 - Feb 10, 2025

This is a simple full-stack website to practice my newly learned skills.
It simulates an ecommerce website for a book store.

It has the following features, though all these features need further development to work optimally.

1. Account login/singup
2. List of products
3. Filter & Search product results
4. Add to cart
5. Add comments
